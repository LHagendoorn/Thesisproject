# Thesisproject
The implementation of all the experiments done in my thesis. This code is currently slightly disorganised, but this will be fixed before, or perhaps slightly after I finish my thesis.

If this code proves to be at all usefull to you, please refer to my thesis, I will (probably) provide an arxiv link when finished.
